    <h1>A little about myself...</h1>
        <p>I have always considered myself good with the "dating game".  Dating can be many different things based on your intentions.  My intentions have spanned from searching for a serious girlfriend to just wanting a physical relationship where little to no emotion is involved.  This has allowed me to refine my practice and become efficient once my true intentions are set.</p>
        <p>Am I a player?  The answer to that question is, "yes".  Does that mean that my approach is unidimensional?  Absolutely not.  I have been equally successful in both playing "the game" as I have been when making myself open to a long term relationship.</p>
    <h2>What I do</h2>  
        <p>Anybody can go out and meet someone in this day and age.  Technology has made it so simple that we can easily be immersed in a sea of romantic prospects by simply "swiping right".  The problem is that most of us don't know what move to make after that.  What is the key to that great first impression?  How can we build interest?  What does the other person really mean in their dialogue?</p>
        <p>This is where I come in.</p>
