    <h1>A little about myself...</h1>
        <p>I have always considered myself good with the "dating game".  Dating can be many different things based on your intentions.  My intentions have spanned from searching for a serious girlfriend to just wanting a physical relationship where little to no emotion is involved.  This has allowed me to refine my practice and become efficient once my true intentions are set.</p>
        <p>Am I a player?  The answer to that question is, "yes".  Does that mean that my approach is unidimensional?  Absolutely not.  I have been equally successful in both playing "the game" as I have been when making myself open to a long term relationship.</p>
    <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>Consider me a coach who's main goal is to get you off the bench and on the all star team.  I do this by helping you thrive in the social aspect that surrounds courtship.</p>  
        <p>Anybody can go out and meet someone in this day and age.  Technology has made it so simple that we can easily be immersed in a sea of romantic prospects.</p>
